# Pedestrian Intention Detection with Hybrid Feature Fusion
The project is based on [Pedestrian Stop and Go Forecasting with Hybrid Feature Fusion](https://github.com/vita-epfl/hybrid-feature-fusion).
## Introduction
The goal of pedestrian intention prediction is to determine, for each prediction timestep, whether a given pedestrian will be crossing or non-crossing the road based on a sequence of past observations.

### Contribution Overview
Drawing inspiration from the *Pedestrian Stop and Go Forecasting with Hybrid Feature Fusion* [1], which focuses on state transition prediction, we adapt their model and approach to our specific crossing/non-crossing task. The model including four modules: **visual information** (encode with CNN), **position and relative velocity** (bounding box), **pedestrain behavior**, **scene description**.

The model employs individual LSTM units for three of modalities and applies a hybrid fusion technique, combining linear projections and concatenations, to integrate the multi-modal embeddings and obtain the final prediction.

## Experimental Setup
In order to maintain consistency and improve the system's performance, we made two important decisions. Firstly, we opted to eliminate scene descriptions from the model to mitigate the risk of overfitting on scene attributes, which can adversely affect evaluation results. This adjustment enables the model to concentrate on learning other pertinent information more efficiently. Secondly, we also chose to exclude behavior data from the system. This decision was driven by the challenge of obtaining such data in real-life scenarios, ensuring that our system remains applicable and practical in real-world applications.

Prior to training the hybrid model, we separately trained the CNN encoder with Resnet18 Backbone (image module) and LSTM encoder (pedestrian motion). These models were then utilized as pretrained checkpoints during the training of the hybrid model.

## Dataset
**JAAD** [2] has been selected as the dataset. **JAAD** focuses on investigating pedestrian road crossing behaviors using a dataset comprising 346 videos which encompassing a range of weather and lighting conditions. Each pedestrian in the dataset is annotated with bounding boxes, behavioral data, and demographic information. 
### Label
- **crossing/non-crossing**: {0: 'not-crossing', 1: 'crossing'}
- 
The label assigned to a given sequence of past observations corresponds to the cross/non-cross label of the given prediction timestep.
### Input
- **visual context**: (channel x image height x image width)

a sequence of RGB images cropped with corresponding pedestrian bounding box and backbround information. 
- **bounding boxes and relative velocities**: $(x_t, y_t, H_t, W_t, \Delta x_t, \Delta y_t, \Delta H_t, \Delta W_t)$

$P_t = (x_t, y_t, H_t, W_t)$ -> bounding box of corresponding pedestrian

$V_t = (\Delta x_t, \Delta y_t, \Delta H_t, \Delta W_t) = (x_t - x_{t-1}, y_t - y_{t-1}, H_t - H_{t-1}, W_t - W_{t-1})$ -> relative velocity of the pedestrian

### Output
- **p<sub>t</sub>**: the probability of crossing for each of the prediction timesteps

## Train
**Hyperparameter:**

max-frames: observation frame length (if not specified, default fps=5, so max-frames=5 means 1 second)

pred: prediction frame length

**Training hybrid model:**
